#YARN

&Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.

    https://yarnpkg.com/en/

    https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn

Fast: Yarn caches every package it has downloaded, so it never needs to download the same package again. It also does almost everything concurrently to maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs.

Reliable: Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another system.

Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.

##Installation

####&Debian/Ubuntu Linux

&On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Yarn via our Debian package repository. You will first need to configure the repository:

    curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
&On Ubuntu 16.04 or below and Debian Stable, you will also need to configure the NodeSource repository to get a new enough version of Node.js.

&Then you can simply:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install yarn

####&macOS

Homebrew

You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

    brew install yarn
If you use nvm or similar, you should exclude installing Node.js so that nvmâ€™s version of Node.js is used.

    brew install yarn --without-node
MacPorts

You can install Yarn through MacPorts. This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

    sudo port install yarn
Upgrade Yarn

Yarn will warn you if a new version is available. To upgrade Yarn, you can do so with Homebrew.

    brew upgrade yarn
Another way to install find https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-tab
